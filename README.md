# 2DarrayOfConjugates
This project aims to created 2D array of DNA and gold nanoparticle conjugates. Given coating DNA and linking DNA topologies, the array of conjugates with different size will be generated. The created DNA and nanoparticle conjugates will be applied for Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate mechanical properties of these arrays
